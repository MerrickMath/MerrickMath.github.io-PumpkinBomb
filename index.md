You may notice that each poumpkin has a unique shape and size. 

We have created *this video* to help you understand what this will look like,and to aid in your estimation. 

You will work in teams of 1-4. Each team must be **clearly** identified. If you submit on multiple teams you will be **disqualified**. Submit estimations (and justifications) using *this form*.
