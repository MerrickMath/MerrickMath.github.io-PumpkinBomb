## Welcome to the PUMPKIN BOMB Challenge
In this challenge you are trying to estimate the number of elastic bands it takes to **IMPLODE** four different pumpkins. 
You may notice that each pumpkin has a unique shape and size. 

We have created <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YJOabLfp-1xUdJ0rJRpUtZUwLfkyxJCw/view?usp=sharing"> this video </a> to help you understand what this will look like,and to aid in your estimation. 

You will work in teams of 1-4. Each team must be **clearly** identified. If you submit on multiple teams you will be **disqualified**. Submit estimations (and justifications) using *this form*. 

GOOD LUCK and MATH ON!
